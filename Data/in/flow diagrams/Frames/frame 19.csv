Estimates of short term life history parameter changes
Reform system to be more resilient to infrequent but high magnitude impacts
"Data: predator abundance, forecast of conditions affecting recruitment survival, in season satelite data"
"Estimates of risk of below average recruitment, higher natural mortatality due to increased natural predation"
