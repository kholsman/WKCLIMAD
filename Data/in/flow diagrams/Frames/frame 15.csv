Define spatial scale
Reform system to be more resilient to infrequent but high magnitude impacts
Reform system to be more resilient to pre-empted impacts (risk based evidence)
Regional short-term projections of climate covariates
Downscaling of models
"Adjust management targets/objectives for management (e.g. reduce yields, reduce acceptable risk, increase precautionary buffers)"
Reform system to be more responsive to monitoring information (adaptive)
Supporting elements
Management tool
Physiological knowledge of species
Stock assessment [[or habitat]] models with climate covariates
Account for uncertainty
Increase adaptive management
Increase real time fisheries management
Diversify opportunities to fish
Model calibration
Biological sampling (time series)
Supporting elements
Supporting elements
"Improve tools for fisheries management including ecological forecasts, climate informed assessments and targets, long term projections"
Increase use of spatial-temporal management measures (more temporal as not thinking about habitat)
Catch data
Plan for changes of fishing opportunities
Stock size monitoring
Knowledge on the current state of the stock
Increase scientists awareness of need for adaption
Increase fishing industry awareness of need for adaption
Environmental variables monitoring
